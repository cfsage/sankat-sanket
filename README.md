# Sankat Sanket  
**Fully Open-Source | Zero-Cost | Community-Powered Climate Resilience Network**

> _From a voice in the dark — to a task in a hand._

## 📖 About the Project
**Sankat Sanket** is a global, open-source initiative to build a **community-driven climate resilience network** — with **no paid APIs**, **no cloud bills**, and **no barriers to access**.

Anyone can report a disaster by capturing a short **photo** or **audio clip**, even without internet. 

On-device AI detects threats like **floods, storms, or fires** and sends **real-time alerts** to nearby users via **voice, text, or emoji notifications**.

Local **volunteers and businesses** can pledge rooms, meals, or supplies.  
AI then matches every reported need with nearby help, and each act of aid is tracked and rewarded with **Resilience Badges**, promoting trust, transparency, and collaboration.
